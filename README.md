# Amazon Prime Air Drone Hub Location Strategy  
**Supply Chain Analytics Project | MSBA – UMass Amherst**

## Project Overview
This project designs an optimal **statewide drone delivery hub network** for Amazon Prime Air across Massachusetts using quantitative location analytics, demographic modeling, and probabilistic demand allocation.

The objective is to determine:

- **Where drone hubs should be located**
- **How much population each hub can serve**
- **How statewide demand is distributed across hubs**
- **What phased deployment strategy maximizes operational impact**

## Business Context
Drone delivery must balance:

- **E-commerce demand growth**
- **Drone technology constraints**
- **Population distribution**
- **Geographic accessibility**

Massachusetts provides an ideal test environment due to its mix of **dense urban demand and underserved rural regions**, making last-mile optimization highly valuable.

## Analytical Framework
The project integrates three core **location-science and demand modeling methods**:

### 1️⃣ Center of Gravity (COG)
- Weighted by **population, income, broadband access, age, and urbanization**
- Identified **Newton, Worcester, and Springfield** as optimal regional hubs
- Ensures hubs align with **true demographic demand centers**

### 2️⃣ Coverage & Volume Modeling
- Newton hub covers **~1.72 million residents within a 15-km radius**
- Estimated **~4,900 daily drone deliveries** in Eastern Massachusetts
- Worcester and Springfield provide **regional coverage balance**

This converts **geographic reach → operational workload**.

### 3️⃣ Huff Gravity Demand Model
- Newton captures **~72% of statewide demand**
- Worcester captures **~16%**
- Springfield captures **~12%**

This probabilistic model combines **hub attractiveness and distance decay** to estimate real customer allocation.

##  Recommended Hub Network

### Newton — Primary Mega Hub
- Aligns with Eastern MA center of gravity  
- Serves **majority of statewide demand (~72%)**  
- Requires **largest fleet, charging infrastructure, and automation**

### Worcester — Central Stabilizing Hub
- Geographic and demographic midpoint of the state  
- Supports **~1,000 daily drone deliveries**  
- Balances operational load between East and West  

### Springfield — Western Anchor Hub
- Ensures **statewide service equity**  
- Serves rural regions with **long traditional delivery times**  
- Enables future **micro-hub expansion**

## Phased Deployment Strategy
**Phase 1 — Newton:**  
Launch flagship hub to capture the majority of demand and refine operations.

**Phase 2 — Worcester:**  
Expand statewide reach and stabilize network flow.

**Phase 3 — Springfield:**  
Complete statewide coverage and enable rural optimization.
